# Logo Generation with LoRA Fine-tuning

A Stable Diffusion 1.5 model fine-tuned with LoRA to generate professional business logos from text descriptions.

## Project Overview

This project implements a specialized logo generation model by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion 1.5 with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). The model is trained on a dataset of modern logo designs to understand and generate business-appropriate visual elements, including:

- Business-specific styling
- Professional color schemes
- Appropriate composition and layout
- Relevant iconography
- Integrated typography

## Features

- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Processes logo images, removes backgrounds, standardizes sizes, and creates augmentations
- **LoRA Training Implementation**: Custom LoRA implementation focusing on attention modules
- **Inference Testing**: Tools to generate and compare logo outputs from different checkpoints
- **Business-specific Generation**: Tailored prompting system for different business types

## How It Works

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Loads logo datasets from Hugging Face
   - Processes images by removing backgrounds and standardizing sizes
   - Parses text descriptions to extract business types and styles
   - Creates augmentations with variations in brightness, rotation, and color
   - Generates standardized prompts for training

2. **LoRA Training**:
   - Implements custom LoRA targeting attention modules
   - Uses high rank (128) for detailed style learning
   - Applies gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
   - Saves checkpoints during training
   - Fine-tunes specifically on self-attention layers

3. **Inference Testing**:
   - Loads the base model with LoRA weights
   - Generates multiple samples per prompt
   - Provides visualization tools for comparing results
   - Offers seed control for reproducibility

## Usage

To generate logos using the model:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the inference notebook:
```python
jupyter notebook notebooks/new_inference_test.ipynb --prompt "A logo for a technology company named 'ByteWave'"
```

Then execute the cells to generate logos with your prompts.

3. Example prompts for good results:
- "A logo for a coffee shop named 'Morning Brew', modern style, brown colors"
- "A logo for a tech startup named 'CodeCraft', minimalist style, with blue/green gradient"
- "A logo for a bakery named 'Sweet Delights', vintage style, with pastel colors"

## Training Details

The model was trained with the following parameters:
- Base model: Stable Diffusion 1.5
- LoRA rank: 128
- LoRA alpha: 128
- Training steps: 10,000
- Batch size: 4 (effective batch size: 16 with gradient accumulation)
- Learning rate: 1e-4
- Resolution: 512Ã—512

## Dataset

This project uses the [Modern Logo Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/logo-wizard/modern-logo-dataset) from Hugging Face, created by logo-wizard. The dataset was processed and augmented for training purposes, resulting in:

- 803 processed logo images
- 2,409 augmented variations
- Total training samples: 3,212

The original dataset is made available for academic research purposes only. All the images are collected from the Internet, and the copyright belongs to the original owners.

### Dataset Citation

If you use this model or the processed dataset in your work, please cite the original dataset:

```bibtex

}
```

## Limitations

- Text rendering: The model may struggle with exact text placement and legibility
- Complex iconography: Very detailed symbols might be simplified
- Layout control: While the model responds to layout cues, exact positioning can vary

## Future Work

- Improved text rendering capabilities
- Higher resolution output
- More business categories
- Style-specific fine-tuning
